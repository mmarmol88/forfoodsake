## Concept


Food waste in the US continues to be a crippling issue which effects everyone in our community. Here are a few stats to illustrate the issue.

##### 40% of all food in the US goes to waste
##### 20% of landfill weight is food waste
##### 49 million Americans struggle to put food on their table
##### 1 in 5 children are at risk of hunger


This app is a humble contribution to a solution that may bring about a much needed change in the dominant culture of waste. We can’t build electric cars or a rocket to mars, but we can build this app in the mean time.

## Overview

The idea for the project came about through a mixture of activism and sustainability. Our main focus was to create an app that promotes waste reduction through food management by bringing businesses and the community together to tackle a common issue and provide a tool to effectively fight hunger.

## Workflow and Responsabilities

During the initial stages of our app build, we used a centralized workflow, but as soon as we had the skeleton built we transitioned into a feature branch workflow to maximize our time. We also prioritized pair programming throught the app build to catch errors and minimize time spent debugging in the long run. For testing, we decided to 'divide and conqure', once again prioritizing our time & to keep things efficient. Below you will find each team members individual responsibilities during the app build.
