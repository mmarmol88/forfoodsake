## Concept


Food waste in the US continues to be a crippling issue which effects everyone in our community. Here are a few state to illustrate the issue.

##### 40% of all food in the US goes to waste
##### 20% of landfill weight is food waste
##### 49 million Americans struggle to put food on their table
##### 1 in 5 children are at risk of hunger


This app is a humble contribution to a solution that may bring about a much needed change in the dominant culture of waste. We canâ€™t build electric cars or a rocket to mars, but we can build this app while we get around to it.

## Overview

The idea for the project came about through a mixture of activism and sustainability. Our main focus was to create an app that promotes waste reduction through food management. Bring businesses and the community together to tackle a common issue and provide a tool to effectively fight hunger.
